In Next.js 15, a potential issue arises when using the `app` directory's features with server components and data fetching.  If a server component attempts to directly access browser-specific APIs (like the `window` object or browser-based libraries), it will result in a runtime error because server components execute on the server, not in the client's browser.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes, especially when dealing with dynamic client-side functionality that's improperly handled within a server component.
